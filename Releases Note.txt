[Release Notes]

- v2.0_beta   [September 28th, 2018][Beta]
    note: This update focused for improve processing
          performance, Improvement of frame quality, cut scenes
          detection and support of GPU acceleration.

          It may take an issue with some older PC
          that doesn't support OpenCL acceleration. For prevent
          that, you can try to disable it with gpu_accel = false

    + Change the project name to nSVPScript.
    + Now, it is available on GitHub. :D
    + ...
    + more than 30+ changes has made. So, I cannot explain them
      here :'>
    + and More of Optimization and Addition.
      Read Default.ini Configuration file for more info :D.
    - Remove "install.bat". 'Coz scripts can load all of
      working directory automatically now. OwO)/
    - Remove ConvertToYV12() function.
    - Remove linear_interpolate option.
    - Remove Prefetch() function from main function.
    - ...
    - and More :3
    # Gives all Motion search range to negative values.
    # Fix search_method 2 and 3 gives invalid motion search
      value.
    # Quality increases on Cutscene Detection and masking by
      normalize all internal value calculation more
      accurate and standarized.
    # Over 20+ bugs fixed OwO)/
    # ...
    # and many of Bug Fixes! UwU)

----------------------------------------------------------------

- r46.s0    [May 31st, 2018][Stable]
    + Motion search improvement for search more blocks.
    + Increase coarse frame size value -> 5812.
    + Decrease maximum coarse frame value -> 2^14 [16384]. 
    + Change Interpolation mode -> 21 for improve masks,
      cover/uncover frames and cutscenes.
    + Decrease mask area value -> 60 for better cover/uncovering
      result.
    + Enable blend frame by default.
    + Using Max() instead of Logic to qualified maximum values.
    + Change vector grip block size to 8x8 by default.
      note: It decreases Processing time.
    + Add config for mask cover/uncover and mask area value.
    + Add warner for mask_area and mask_cover.
    + Change plevel value by logic.
        if coarse_max's calcs > 512, change to 1
        if coarse_max's calcs > 1024, change to 2
        if coarse_max's calcs > 2048, change to 4
        if coarse_max's calcs empty, change to 4 [default]
    + Increase lambda n Value -> 13.
    + Add warner for search_range.
    + Replace some "bad word function" into NO().
    # Fix typos in some script.

----------------------------------------------------------------

- r31.s0    [May 27th, 2018][Stable]
    + Decrease motion search distance value to 32 by default.
    + Increase coarse frame size value to 3200 by default.
    + Increase maximum memory usage value to 512 MB.
    + Shorten variables name.
    + Add config to enable/disable SATD algorithm.
    + Add Warner for user if value isn't correct.
    + Move MTDefault thread mode 3 and SVPFlow functions
      thread mode to 2.
    + Increase interpolation framerate to 49.940fps.
    + Move input variable from _init to
      FunctionInterpolateParam class.
    + Change vector grip block size to 32x32.
    + Add config for motion coherences value.
    + Change frame masking value to 80.67 for better result.
    - Remove some unused and old variables.
    # Fix SetMemoryMax not applies value from configuration.
    # Fix performance will leaked if runs in AMD based
      CPU/GPU. It caused by SATD algorithm if it turns on.
    # Disable trymany and frame sorting algorithm. It also
      decreases processing performance at some case.
    # Fix some DS based player stuck by increases interpolation
      framerate to drop-frame [e.g. 49.940fps/59.940fps] by
      default.

----------------------------------------------------------------

- r14.b2    [May 23rd, 2018][Beta]
    + Motion search improvement for search more blocks.
    + Change pixel_precision to 1 by default.
    + Make demo mode text scalable by following video
      resolution.
    + Add p or i indicator text in demo mode header.
    + Move ConvertToYV12() from Thread class to _init class.
    + Replace [n]fps text in demo mode to [n]fps/[mode].
    + Divide framerate value by 2 in demo mode if interlace mode
      was enabled.
    + Increase maximum memory usage value to 384 MB.
    + Change title text in ConfigurationHandler.
    + Change blend_frame to false by default.
    + Add some formulas to calculate motion search range.
    + Enable SATD in motion search, coarse frame and refine
      search to improve masking some covered/uncovered vectors.
    + Implement block size configuration for block matching
      algorithm.
    + Implement motion search range configuration.
    + Implement motion search method configuration.
    + Implement maximum coarse frame size configuration.
    - Remove unused MTMode in interlace and demo mode.
    # Fix plain and smoothed video frame aren't syncronized
      by each other in demo mode [maybe affects
      to processing performance].

----------------------------------------------------------------
