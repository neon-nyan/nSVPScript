[Release Notes]

- v2.0   [August 5th, 2018][Stable]
    note: This update focused to improve processing
          performance, Improvement of frame quality, cut scenes
          detection and support of GPU acceleration.

          It may take an issue with some older PC
          that doesn't support OpenCL acceleration. For prevent
          that, you can try to disable it with gpu_accel = false

    + Re-factor some code styles to be more acceptable.
    + Set max_memory value -> 1024 or -/+ 4GB.
    + Set Max CPU threads usage -> 5 threads.
    + Set mask area value -> 32 for better cover/uncovering
      result.
    + Enable OpenCL GPU acceleration by default.
    + Change vector grip size -> 16x16 with 0 overlap by
      default.
    + Change search_method -> 2 [Hexagon search].
    + Make demo frames syncronized again.
    + Make blend_frame mode enabled by default.
    + Re-align frame size in demo into correct value.
    + Performance increases in demo_mode.
      Note: if you're using ffdshow, make sure that
      "Buffer back/ahead" was enabled before.
    + Decrease search_range value -> 5.
    + Normalize scene limit values in smoothfps_params variable.
      It increases smoothness of frame a bit.
    + Normalize refine's thsad values in analyse_params
      variable. It also increases mask quality and small
      improvement of Cut Scenes detection. :3
    + Decrease coarse_max value -> 1500.
    + Now automatically using Cubic instead of Bilinear for
      interpolation when GPU acceleration activated.
    + Set lambda for motion vectors pinalty value -> 10.
    + Make SVAnalyse be able to using GPU acceleration if
      it was Enabled.
    + Change Default_MT_MODE -> mode 2.
    + Use Assert() instead of Subtitle() and logic for displays
      error and warning messages for now.
    + Add boolean value type to warner.
    + Move vertical stack frame mode in demo to demo_type = 2
    + Evaluate demo types as list.
    + Add new demo types. These are:
        1   =   Horizontal stack frame. [Default]
        2   =   Vertical stack frame.
        3   =   Frame difference in chroma.
                [requires MaskTools 2]
      you can switch between these types with
      demo_type = [number]
    + Make framerate conversion in demo mode more accurate.
    + Add subfunction nNumSeparate() for separate float from
      its fraction.
    + Use Round() instead of Floor() to Rounding floats.
    + Remove ParamCustomConfig class because it will not be used
      for futher reason, All new configurations now written
      in ConfigurationHandler class. ;)
    + Add clip scaling feature. To activate it, write:
      "global scale=true" in your configuration file.
    + Add Preset feature. To activate it, write:
      "global preset=[number_of_preset_index]" in your
      configuration file.
    + Revamp version system more simple to manage. :\_/
    + Override _init input to scaled input if scale == true.
    + Change the project name to nSVPScript.
    + Now, it is available on GitHub. :D
    - Remove "install.bat". 'Coz scripts can load all of
      working directory automatically now. OwO)/
    - Remove ConvertToYV12() function.
    - Remove linear_interpolate option.
    - Remove Prefetch() function from main function.
    # Gives all Motion search range to negative values.
    # Fix search_method 2 and 3 gives invalid motion search
      value.
    # Quality increases on Cutscene Detection and masking by
      normalize all internal value calculation more
      accurate and standarized.

    # Fix performance will leaked if runs in AMD based
      CPU/GPU. It caused by SATD algorithm if it turns on.
    # Disable trymany and frame sorting algorithm. It also
      decreases processing performance at some case.
    # Fix some DS based player stuck by increases interpolation
      framerate to drop-frame [e.g. 49.940fps/59.940fps] by
      default.
