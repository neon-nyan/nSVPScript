How to use it?
...
It's too pretty simple AF :)

Note: Don't forget to convert the input clip into YV12.

First, import the _main.avs in your Script using Import() function
e.g.
    Import("C:\your\waifu\is\a\trash\nSVPScript\_main.avs")

then, add nSVPScript() function in your Avisynth Script...
or nSVPScript64() if you're running on x64 Avisynth MT.
and voila!!!, your video run interpolated by SVPFlow. Horray!!! :D

P.S. You can also configure your own configs or another
     codes that you've wrote in Settings/UserSettings.ini BTW
     note: See Settings/Default.ini for future config guides.

Some note again:
    Enable "Buffer back/ahead". Then, set value to 16 and 32 if you
    play it with demo_mode turns on.
